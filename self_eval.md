# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
# 7/10

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
# 6/10 It seems easy, but I am sure there are variations of things I haven't tried yet that would
# confuse me.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
# I would like to know if there is an easier way to code the arguments inputs.
