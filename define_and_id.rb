# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")
# The include? method is called on the string object "Hello World"
#The "Hello" argument is passed to check if the string "Hello World" has the argument included within it "
# The return value is True

end

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
# The end_with? method is called on the string object "Hellow World"
# The argument .end_with? is passed. end_with? identifies if the string "Hello World" has "Hello" in the end of that string.
# The string does not end with "Hello" and the output is false.


"Hello World".end_with?("rld")
# The argument "rld" is passed on the string "Hello World"
# The return value is true.

12.even?
# The even? method is called for the integer 12.
# Even? method checks if 12 is an even number
# The output is true.


18.next
# The next method is called on the integer 18
# next method is used to find out what is after 18
# The output is 19
